## Documentation Dependencies (Optional)

The following dependencies are used only for building documentation and are not included in the distributed software:

### Sphinx and Related Packages

**License:** BSD License (various versions)  
**Usage:** Documentation generation  
**Components:**
- sphinx==7.1.2
- sphinx-rtd-theme==1.3.0  
- breathe==4.35.0
- furo==2023.9.10
- exhale==0.3.7

These packages are used only during the documentation build process and are not part of the distributed parrot library.

## Build Tools

### CMake

**License:** BSD 3-Clause License  
**Usage:** Build system configuration  
**Minimum Version:** 3.10

CMake is used as the build system but is not distributed with the project.

## Notes

1. **NVIDIA Components:** All NVIDIA-authored components (CCCL, Thrust, CUB, libcudacxx, CUDA Toolkit) are licensed under terms compatible with Apache 2.0 or are proprietary NVIDIA software used under appropriate licensing terms.

2. **Runtime Dependencies:** The parrot library requires NVIDIA CUDA runtime libraries to be installed on the target system. These are not distributed with parrot and must be obtained separately from NVIDIA.

3. **Header-Only Libraries:** Some dependencies are header-only libraries that are compiled into the final binary. Their license terms are preserved in this document.

4. **FetchContent:** Dependencies marked as using CMake FetchContent are automatically downloaded during the build process from their respective repositories.

## License Compatibility

All third-party dependencies used in parrot are compatible with the Apache License 2.0 under which parrot is distributed:

- **Apache 2.0 (NVIDIA CCCL components):** Fully compatible
- **MIT (doctest):** Compatible with Apache 2.0-cpp
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit:** Proprietary license, used under appropriate terms

## Compliance

This project complies with all license requirements of its dependencies:

1. All required copyright notices are preserved
2. License texts are included where required
3. Attribution requirements are met
4. No incompatible license combinations exist
